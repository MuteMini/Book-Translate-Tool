# Book Translate Tool
Personal python tool to turn images of non-english books into an easily translatable base-slate pdf.

## Installing Package
Run ```pip install requirements.txt``` to install all modules.

Go into the src directory and run ```python main.py```. The app should immediately open in a new window.

## Running Release

So far, only Windows 64-bit OS is supported, as I used PyInstaller to form the python bin files. There are no plans to deploy this desktop app to more environments.
